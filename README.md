# lifi_defi_game

A daily script to monitor LiFi employees activity in our DeFi Game.

We look at three things:

- Holdings in USD
- Number of protocols where users are invested in (Debank for EVM, Sonar Watch for Solana)
- Jumper activity (number of chains, volume of transactions)


Scoring is computed based on the resulting dataframe from this script.
